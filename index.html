                    The PS2 is often considered one of the greatest consoles due to its vast game library, including
                    classics like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Metal Gear Solid 3. The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a
                    home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was first
                    released in Japan on 4 March 2000, in North America on 26 October 2000, in Europe on 24 November
                    2000, and in Australia on 30 November 2000. It is the successor to the original PlayStation, as well
                    as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of consoles. As a sixth-generation console, it
                    competed with Nintendo's GameCube, Sega's Dreamcast, and Microsoft's Xbox. It is the best-selling
                    video game console of all time, having sold over 155 million units worldwide. Announced in 1999,
                    Sony began developing the console after the immense success of its predecessor. The highlight of the
                    system was its Emotion Engine processor, co-developed by Sony and Toshiba, which was said to be more
                    powerful than personal computers. The PS2 offered backward compatibility for its predecessor's
                    DualShock controller, as well as its games.

                    The NES is a pioneer in the gaming world and brought us iconic games like Super Mario Bros. and The
                    Legend of Zelda. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video
                    game console produced by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan in 1983 as the Family Computer
                    (FC), commonly referred to as Famicom. It was redesigned to become the NES, which was released in
                    American test markets on October 18, 1985, and was soon fully launched in North America and other
                    countries. After developing several successful arcade games in the early 1980s such as Donkey Kong
                    (1981), Nintendo planned to create a home video game console. Rejecting more complex proposals, the
                    Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi called for a simple, cheap console with games stored on
                    cartridges. The controller design was reused from Nintendo's portable Game & Watch games. Nintendo
                    released several add-ons, such as the NES Zapper light gun for shooting games like Duck Hunt.
